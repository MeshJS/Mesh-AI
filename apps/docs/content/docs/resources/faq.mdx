- And many more!

The wallet integration is universal, so any new CIP-30 wallet is automatically supported.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I build a wallet application with Mesh?">
Absolutely! Mesh provides the `MeshWallet` class that allows you to create wallet applications. You can:
- Generate wallets from mnemonic phrases
- Import wallets from private keys
- Work with cardano-cli wallets
- Build multi-signature applications
- Create browser extension wallets

Check out the [Wallet documentation](/apis/wallets) for details.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I connect a wallet in my dApp?">
Use the `CardanoWallet` React component for the easiest integration:

```tsx
import { CardanoWallet } from '@meshsdk/react';

export default function MyApp() {
  return (
    <CardanoWallet
      label="Connect Wallet"
      persistence={true}
      onConnected={() => console.log('Wallet connected!')}
    />
  );
}
```

See our [wallet hooks documentation](/react/wallet-hooks) for more advanced use cases.
</Accordion>

const tx = new Transaction({ initiator: wallet })
  .sendLovelace(
    'addr1...', // recipient address
    '1000000'   // 1 ADA in lovelace
  );

const unsignedTx = await tx.build();
const signedTx = await wallet.signTx(unsignedTx);
const txHash = await wallet.submitTx(signedTx);
```

See the [Transaction Builder documentation](/apis/transaction) for advanced features.
</Accordion>
